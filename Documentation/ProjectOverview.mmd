  %% Core Data Flow & Control
  GameLogic --> CharacterPersistence : Manages player state (e.g., resetPj)
  GameLogic --> Database_Queries : (Implicitly) For various data lookups
  GameLogic --> AI_NPC : Triggers/influences NPC states
  GameLogic --> EffectsOverTime : Applies/Removes effects based on game events
  GameLogic --> Comercio : Initiates/terminates trade sessions
  
  CharacterPersistence --> Database_Queries : Uses queries for DB operations
  
  Admin --> CharacterPersistence : Accesses/modifies persistent player data (bans, etc.)
  Admin --> Database_Queries : (Implicitly) For admin-related DB operations
  Admin --> GameLogic : (Potentially) To trigger server-wide actions

  %% API Interactions
  API --> GameLogic : (Potentially) Forwards commands for game state changes
  API --> CharacterPersistence : (Via GameLogic or directly) For player data for external API
  
  %% Utility Usage
  Comercio --> GameLogic : Uses utility functions (e.g., for position checks)
  AI_NPC --> GameLogic : Uses utility functions (positioning, visibility)
  EffectsOverTime --> GameLogic : Uses utility functions
  
  %% Crypto Usage (Illustrative - actual usage might be more specific)
  API --> AO20CryptoSysWrapper : (Potentially) For secure communication
  CharacterPersistence --> AO20CryptoSysWrapper : (Potentially) For encrypting sensitive data
  
  %% General Dependencies (Illustrative of data access, not direct calls in all cases)
  Comercio --> CharacterPersistence : (Indirectly) Affects player gold/inventory
  AI_NPC --> CharacterPersistence : (Indirectly) NPCs target players
  EffectsOverTime --> CharacterPersistence : (Indirectly) Effects are on players
  
  note "This diagram shows plausible high-level interactions. Actual calls can be more nuanced (e.g., via shared data structures like UserList, NpcList, or more specific utility modules not shown at this level)."
